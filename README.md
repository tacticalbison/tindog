## Things I learned in this section

**<u>CDN:</u>** _Content Delivery Network_. This is something I was not taught about during Fullstack Academy bootcamp. I had no idea that you could pull in the framework as a cache and this has the effect of potentially decreasing latency of loading websites you visit frequently. This is an enormous positive for a popular framework such as Bootstrap as an user can potentially have this exact framework cached from a visit to another website using the same framework!

**<u>TBD:</u>**

**<u>Personal notes:</u>**
When working with the Carousel built-in feature of Bootstrap, I wondered how this might be made accessible to those with keyboards or those with vision issues. After reading the documentation, I found the use of `data-bs-keyboard` and `data-bs-pause` to be helpful on those. During testing, however, I couldn't seem to get the keyboard controls to work. Will have to research this and study accessibility controls a bit more in a future study session.
