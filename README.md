## Things I learned in this section

**<u>CDN:</u>** _Content Delivery Network_. This is something I was not taught about during Fullstack Academy bootcamp. I had no idea that you could pull in the framework as a cache and this has the effect of potentially decreasing latency of loading websites you visit frequently. This is an enormous positive for a popular framework such as Bootstrap as an user can potentially have this exact framework cached from a visit to another website using the same framework!
